## New features ✨
- A complete rewrite of the trading feature
  - Backward compatible with the existing bookmarks
  - No more glitchy auto-scrolls
  - Easier to use for quick search
- Atlas maps searching
  - Can search through almost every map's fields
- Challenges tracker
  - Automatically loaded from the official website
  - Calculate the real progress by aggregating the sub-challenges progress

## Enhancements 💅
- Prevent the application from rendering in a too compact viewport

## Bug fixes 🐛
- Atlas
  - Removed the pantheon purple animation (caused severe lags)

Atlas maps will still be off for a while. It takes time for the wiki's team to keep track with the constant Atlas layout changes.
